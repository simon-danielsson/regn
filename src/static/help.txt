Regn queries WeatherAPI to fetch its weather data. To use this application, you must supply your own API key. 
Details on how to generate a key can be found on WeatherAPIs developer page: https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/
Add your key to a new file in your home ($HOME) directory named ".regn": ~/.regn
